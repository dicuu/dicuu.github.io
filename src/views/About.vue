        <div class="card-body p-4">
            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate engineer who loves programming and system design, specializing in building
                reliable and maintainable backend services along with modern frontend experiences.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-decoration-underline">Interests:</strong> Distributed systems, performance optimization, and developer experience.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-decoration-underline">Background:</strong> With extensive experience in full-stack development, I focus on creating
                efficient solutions that bridge the gap between complex backend architectures and intuitive user
                interfaces. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and transforming ideas into robust, scalable
                applications.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-decoration-underline">Philosophy:</strong> I believe in writing clean, well-documented code and continuously learning
                new technologies to improve both product quality and development processes.</p>
